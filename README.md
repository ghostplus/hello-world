# obstacle avoidance simple demo

This is a small demo, how it is possible to avoid obstacles using 4 ultrasonic sensors and PID controllers.
To run this game, you need to install pygame and numpy modules in Python (numpy is used only for generation of random numbers - this is actually not important).

demo.py - demo

demo2.py - demo with "follow me" module

P.S. This is just a test.
